# Hotel-Management-Website
It's a desktop-based application made using Java. It permits the managing chief to deal with all inn exercises on the web. The admin can add new rooms, update the status/availability of the rooms, update the number of rooms. Currently I am updating the project and adding real life applications to it, for example : add new drivers for pick-up service, add new employees database and much more.
